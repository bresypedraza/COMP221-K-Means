# COMP221-K-Means - James Bradley, Carissa Bolante, Bresy Perez

This is an implementation of Lloyd's Algorithm for our COMP221 Final Project. Using our pseudocode and source (1) as a template, we constructed a script that will generate random data and assign each data point to a cluster. To check the accuracy of the assignments, we have a visualization for the optimal assignments for each data point (color-coded) and the actual output of our algorithm.

This project was initially implemented in Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17oM7jpM3pv4cYgvKE0hEW7mbBr-HUBZB?usp=sharing
