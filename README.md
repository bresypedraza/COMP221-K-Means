# COMP221-K-Means - James Bradley, Carissa Bolante, Bresy Perez

This is an implementation of Lloyd's Algorithm for our COMP221 Final Project. Using our pseudocode and source (1) as a template, we constructed a script that will generate random data and assign each data point to a cluster. To check the accuracy of the assignments, we have a visualization for the optimal assignments for each data point (color-coded) and the actual output of our algorithm.
